About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing user reviews from the TikTok app available on the Google Play Store to understand user sentiments better. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to derive insights from textual data, identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments expressed by users. The analysis provides valuable feedback for app developers and marketers, helping them improve user experience and engagement.
